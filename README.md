# Personal Portfolio

This is my website I created to display my own projects. I will continue to update this website as I continue on in my coding journey. There is an "About Me" portion that introduces who I am and what my interests are. I also display my projects in the "My Work" sections of the website. My contact information is at the bottom of the website!
